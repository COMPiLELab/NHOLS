# NHOLS
The Nonlinear Higher Order Label Spreading algorithm Julia package

This library does semi-supervised learning algorithm **NHOLS** or **LS** (Label Spreading) on a number of prepared datasets or on datasets provided by a user. The code is supplementary to the paper on [NHOLS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04762)
